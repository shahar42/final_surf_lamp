Create files:
- setup_database.py  
- seed_data.sql

GENERATE ONLY PYTHON/SQL CODE:

setup_database.py should:
- Connect to PostgreSQL using psycopg2
- Create all tables from the schema
- Set up foreign key constraints and indexes
- Handle existing tables gracefully

seed_data.sql should contain:
- INSERT statements for sample locations (San Diego, Santa Cruz, Honolulu, etc.)
- Sample API configurations for Surfline and WeatherAPI
- Sample users and lamps for testing

Include proper foreign key constraints, indexes for performance.
Must work with PostgreSQL and psycopg2.
