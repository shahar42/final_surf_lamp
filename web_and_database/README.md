# web_and_database - Component Overview

## Purpose & Role
- **What this component does**: This component provides a web interface for users to interact with the surf lamp system and an API for the `surf-lamp-processor` to fetch data.
- **Position in overall architecture**: This is the frontend and data storage component of the project.
- **Primary responsibility**: To provide a user interface for registration, login, and dashboard views, and to expose an API for the background processor.

## Key Files & Functions
### Critical Files
- `app.py` - The main Flask application file that defines the routes and handles web requests.
- `data_base.py` - Contains the database models and functions for interacting with the database.
- `forms.py` - Contains the forms for the web application, such as login and registration forms.
- `security_config.py` - Contains security-related configurations.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for this component.
- `templates/` - Contains the HTML templates for the web pages.
- `test_endpoints.sh` - A shell script for testing the API endpoints.

### Entry Points
- **Main execution**: The `app.py` script is the primary entry point for running the web server.
- **API endpoints**: This component exposes API endpoints for the `surf-lamp-processor` to fetch data.
- **External interfaces**: This component provides a web interface for users.

## Data Flow
### Inputs
- **Receives from**: Users interact with the web interface, and the `surf-lamp-processor` calls the API endpoints.
- **Input format**: HTTP requests from users' browsers and JSON requests from the `surf-lamp-processor`.
- **Trigger conditions**: User actions in the web browser or requests from the `surf-lamp-processor`.

### Outputs
- **Sends to**: The `surf-lamp-processor` component.
- **Output format**: HTML pages to the user's browser and JSON data to the `surf-lamp-processor`.
- **Side effects**: This component reads from and writes to the database.

## Dependencies & Configuration
### External Dependencies
- **Database**: This component requires a database to store user data and other information.
- **APIs**: This component does not call any external APIs.
- **Network**: Requires network access to serve the web pages and API endpoints.
