        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Surf Lamp is an informational device, not safety equipment. Surf conditions are estimates only. Use at your own risk. We're not responsible for injuries, property damage, or incorrect surf data. One-year warranty for hardware defects.

            <li>The lamp does NOT account for rip currents, hazardous marine life, water quality, or other safety hazards</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>USER RESPONSIBILITY:</strong></p>

            <li>ALWAYS check professional surf forecasts (e.g., Surfline, Magicseaweed) and local conditions before entering the water</li>
            <li>NEVER rely solely on the Surf Lamp to make safety decisions</li>
            <li>Use appropriate safety equipment (leash, wetsuit, etc.) and surf within your skill level</li>
            <li>By using this Service, you accept full responsibility for your safety while surfing or kitesurfing</li>
